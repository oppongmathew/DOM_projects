# DOM Manipulation – JavaScript Project Work

This repository contains three beginner‑friendly JavaScript mini projects that demonstrate 
"DOM selection & manipulation, array/JSON iteration, and form calculations".

# Projects

 1) To‑Do List
    
* Type a task and click **Add** to append it to the list.
* Each task renders as an "<li>" with a **Delete** button to remove it from the DOM.

2) Student Scores Table (Loop Through JSON)

* Iterates an in‑memory JSON array of students and displays **name** and **score** in a table.
* Scores **> 80** are styled in red.
  

 3) Shopping Cart Calculator (Form + Calculation)

* Enter **price** and **quantity**, click **Add** to list the item and its total (price × quantity).
* Shows a running **Grand Total** of all items.
